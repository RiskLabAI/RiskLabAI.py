    Calculates hedging weights using covariance, risk distribution, and risk target.

    The function uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the weights.
    If the risk distribution is not provided, all risk is allocated to the principal
    component with the smallest eigenvalue.

    :param risk_distribution: Risk distribution, defaults to None.
    :param risk_target: Risk target, defaults to 1.0.

    :return: Weights calculated based on PCA.
